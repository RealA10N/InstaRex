# Instabot

Free Instagram python bot, [private Instagram API emulator](https://github.com/instagrambot/instabot/tree/master/instabot/api) and a [huge amount of ready-to-use example scripts](https://github.com/instagrambot/instabot/tree/master/examples).

We are the most used Instagram library on GitHub (according to "Used by" counter). ðŸŽ‰ Join our [Large Telegram community](https://t.me/instabotproject) for more Instagram tricks. ðŸš€


### Important

Right now the usage of this library (as probably others too) may harm your Instagram's profile because of new script-detection algorithms. You were warned.

Instabot has a lot of predefined filters (like skipping very popular accounts because they will not notice you) which maximizes the overall impact. But you can remove them if you like or even set your parameters: (full list [here](https://github.com/instagrambot/instabot/blob/master/instabot/bot/bot.py#L86))
